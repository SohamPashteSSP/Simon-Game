# Simon-Game
A Simon Game made using HTML, CSS and jQuery. Simon is an electronic game of short-term memory skill. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over. This wesite is an simulated version of the Simon Game.
